          <q>My name is Raghad Sharaf, and I'm a Civil Engineer who has strong
            background in Civil Engineering with 7+ years of experience, I bring
            a unique perspective to problem-solving and project management. I've
            gained experience in architectural and civil engineering, working on
            various design projects, preparing detailed shop drawings, and managing
            office and team operations. My work has involved site visits, project
            supervision, and consultations, where I've honed my attention to
            detail and ability to work under pressure.</q>
